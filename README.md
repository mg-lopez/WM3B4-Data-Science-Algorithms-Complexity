# WM3B4-Data-Science-Algorithms-Complexity (Year 3)
This module develops the central concepts and skills required to design, implement and analyse algorithms for solving problems. Algorithms are essential in all advanced areas of technical cyber security and related subjects, including artificial intelligence, databases, data science, distributed computing, graphics, networking, operating systems, programming languages and security. An important part of using them well is the ability to select algorithms appropriate to particular purposes and to apply them, recognising the possibility that no suitable algorithm may exist. This facility relies on understanding the range of algorithms that address an important set of well- defined problems, recognising their strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability in particular contexts in combination with complementary data structures. Efficiency is a pervasive theme and a clear understanding of algorithmic complexity is essential if efficient algorithms are to be designed and used.
